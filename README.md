This repo is just a couple of audiovisual experiments.

How to run it:

- Clone the repo, open it in VS-code , install the Live Server Extention in VS-code
- Right click on index.html "Open with Live Server" and thats it, pretty easy right?
- Click somewhere in the screen to start the sound.

Vision of this repo:

The idea is to collaborate by sharing code ideas with each other. If you dont know where to start, just copy paste the "acrylicode.js" (or any other .js file in this repo) and modify it however you want. Once you have a result you are happy with share it with us! 

Development rules:

- This is creative coding, so there is no code quality standard, commented lines are allowed, messy code , crazy and meaningless variables aswell as arbitrary values are also allowed. 
- For development, create your own .js file and name it with your artist name or some unique name.
- Your .js should have implemeted the setup() and draw() functions, ideally the draw() should only call one single function. In that way you can develop multiple different ideas and prototype them quickly by separating them in functions.

Example:

function idea1(){
    // p5 audiovisual code
}

function idea2(){
    // p5 audiovisual code
}

function draw(){
    idea1() // ideally the draw() function should be as clean as possible 
}

- Then for the development sake modify the index.html by importing your .js file instead of "acrylicode.js" DO NOT COMMIT ANY CHANGES TO THE index.html. ONLY CHANGES in your .js file.
- If you are not a collaborator and want to be one (you can DM me per Instagram @acrylicode.berlin) so I can invite you or you can just fork the repo and create a pull request against the master branch so you an also contribute.
- ALWAYS create a branch and once you want to share, create a pull request to the master branch.
- Your pull request should ONLY contain changes in your .js file and NOT in the index.html or other .js files. 
- Dont upload .wav files , only .mp3
- Copy pasting code from others is allowed, so do it!
- Sharing is caring and only through sharing we can achieve great things. Hope you share that mentality.



Happy coding and if you have questions or suggestions contact me via Instagram.
